import { Meta, Primary, Source, Controls } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as componentStories from "./customLayout.stories";

<Meta of={componentStories} />

**If you need more control over the structure of the `Card` component, you can do that by using compound component. Have a look at the example below.**

First import the `Card` component.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={`import {InputField} from '@metalnet/baremetal/input';`}
/>

And change structure as the way you want.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={`<Card className=" min-w-full">
  <Card.Heading el="h1">Title here</Card.Heading>
  <Card.Body el="div">This is card body</Card.Body>
</Card>`}

/>

<Primary />
<Controls />
```
